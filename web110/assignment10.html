        Fortunately, I already knew how to add audio and images to a website, but I had never learned how to embed
        videos before. It was also helpful to learn about different media formats like .ogg, since I was only familiar
        with .mp3 and .mp4 files for audio. Understanding how to control features like autoplay when a website loads is
        important, too. Additionally, learning how to adjust image sizes is crucial to ensure they don't appear
        stretched or out of place alongside other elements.
