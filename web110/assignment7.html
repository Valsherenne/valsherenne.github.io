    <h1>Assignment 7</h1>
    <p>
        Activity 1: Complete the following tutorials
        The Internet Safety tutorial helped me understand how to protect personal information online, such
        as using strong passwords/spotting phishing scams. When it comes to using these skills in real life, I'm more
        cautious about emails and data during work. In the future, I'll apply these skills in web design to keep user
        information
        safe.

        The TutorialsPoint tutorial covered things like firewalls, antivirus software, and
        multi-factor authentication. I already use these to keep my devices secure, and in the future, I'll make sure
        the websites I design have strong security measures to protect users' data.

        Activity 3: Use anti-malware software to scan your system and test malware detection
        I looked through the linked page Wikipedia and used the default windows defender
        program to scan my system. This helped me understand the importance of regular scans for detecting threats,
        especially if I'm downloading a file and I'm not sure about its source.

        I also reviewed the EICAR test file and used it to test my anti-malware software. The file triggered
        an alert, which allowed me to follow the malware removal process. With this knowlege, I'm reassured that
        my security software works. In the future, I'll continue running scans and keeping my devices protected to
        maintain strong cybersecurity in both my personal and professional environments.
