    <p>Activity 1: What is Accesibiliy?
        Accessibility means designing websites so everyone, no matter what disability or impairment they have.
        So when creating a website, it involves considering various impairments—such as visual, auditory, motor, or
        cognitive challenges—and ensuring that web content is still accessible them. For example, adding text
        descriptions to
        images helps visually impaired users understand the content, while providing captions for videos aids those who
        are deaf or hard of hearing. By focusing on accessibility for my future work, I can create a more inclusive and
        user-friendly web experience for everyone.</p>

    <p>Activity 5: Paletton
        The Paletton website is a great tool to experiment and understand how various color schemes work. In the future,
        I know I'll find tools like Paletton super helpful for creating designs that are both visually appealing and
        functional. By experimenting with color schemes like monochromatic, adjacent-color, three-color, and four-color,
        I can make my websites more engaging and balanced. </p>
