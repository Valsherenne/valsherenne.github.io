    <h1>Assignment 9</h1>

    <p style="color: white;">
        Since I already had some prior knowledge of external style sheets, I didn't have much
        difficulty figuring out how to work on the rest of them. What I didn't know, however, was the difference between
        inline and internal style sheets. I always assumed they were the same. What I also didn't realize was the
        difference in priorities when it came to inserting a style sheet, to the point that even the default does not
        matter. I hope to use what I learned about internal and inline sheets to create better-looking websites.
