    <h1>Assignment 9</h1>

    <p> Since I already had some prior knowledge of external style sheets, I didn't have much difficulty figuring out
        how to work on the rest of them. What I didn't know, however, was the difference between inline and internal
        style sheets. I always assumed they were the same. What I also didn't realize was the difference in priorities
        when it came to inserting a style sheet, to the point that even the default does not matter. I hope to use what
        I learned about internal and inline sheets to create better looking websites.
