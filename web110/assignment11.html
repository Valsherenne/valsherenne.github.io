        I learned a lot about how the Northwind database is structured and how different tables connect. The Orders and
        OrderDetails tables are linked through OrderID, showing how one order can have multiple products. The Customers
        table uses CustomerID as its unique identifier, and the Categories table includes details like name and
        description. Plus, I got some practice with sorting, filtering, and calculating totals,
        which gave me a better understanding of how databases organize and retrieve information efficiently.
