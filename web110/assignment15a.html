    <p>Resume and LinkedIn Profile

        Completing the activity opened my eyes to what recruiters actually value. Before
        this, I thought my resume and LinkedIn were pretty solid, but now I realize I can improve them by clearly
        highlighting my skills and experiences. I learned that recruiters pay attention to specific keywords and
        achievements, so I made sure to include those in my resume. I also learned how to craft a concise summary that 
        reflects my career goals. Through this activity, I now feel more confident about
        presenting myself professionally. In my future job searches, I will continue to tailor my resume and LinkedIn
        profile to highlight relevant skills and achievements for each position I apply to.
