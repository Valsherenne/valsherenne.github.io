      Wikiversity Activity Name: The name of the activity that I've done was activity 5: IP Address and Geolocation. 
      The Topic I'm Describing: The activity involves understanding what an IP Address is and where you can find both of your addresses: IPv4 (The most common IP) and IPv6 (A newer, longer IP that's harder to find).
      What I learned is that if your IP address is easy to find, anyone can figure out where your location is using just a couple of Google searches. So it's best to be as careful as possible on the internet and how important cybersecurity is. Luckily enough, it's pretty easy to change your IP address on your computer too.</p>
