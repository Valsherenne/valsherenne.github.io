        Activity 4: View Email Message Headers
        This activity involves understanding email sender addresses and how others can "spoof" their own addresses so
        they look less suspicious to the normal user. In doing so, they can get through an unsuspecting user's
        information after that user clicks on whatever link they sent them. There are many ways to see if the sender
        address is legitimate. One way could be viewing the email source information, and another way can be by just
        hovering over the address, just to see if the link actually goes to where it will go. With this knowledge, I'd
        be able to use it by making sure to use these techniques to any sender or link I find suspicious.

        Activity 2: Send, receive, and respond to email
        For this activity, I completed the task on creating, sending, and replying to emails. With all this together, I
        can improve my confidence in email etiquette and functions. Emails are essential for job
        applications, networking, and business interactions; so developing strong email skills prepares me for success
        in school, work, and beyond. This makes sure I can communicate effectively in a world where snail mail isn't as
        effective.
