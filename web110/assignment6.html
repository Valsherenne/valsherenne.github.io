        Activity 2: Review IP address settings for your local network
        In this activity, I explored how to check IP address settings, use ipconfig to view network details, and release
        a dynamic IP. I also learned how to troubleshoot connectivity issues,and manage network settings more
        effectively. This is super useful for keeping a stable internet connection. Understanding network is key for
        collaboration and productivity, no matter what career I'm in. Knowing how to handle IP settings will definitely
        come in handy in both my current enviorment as a student and future work environments.

        Activity 4: Share a folder and connect to the shared folder
        In this activity, I learned how to share a folder on my computer and access it from another device using a UNC
        path. I set permissions, made sure network discovery was enabled, and connected. This helped me understand
        file-sharing security and access controls. I can see this being useful in a collaborative work environment, 
        whether sharing design assets, project files, or documents. As I move into web design, knowing how to manage 
        shared resources will help streamline work and keep files easily accessible across multiple devices.
