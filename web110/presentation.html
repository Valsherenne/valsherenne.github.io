    <p> In Web110, I learned how essential graphics and multimedia are in creating engaging, functional websites. I now
        understand the differences between raster and vector images, and when to use each type depending on the design
        needs. I also gained practical experience embedding audio and video using HTML, and styling these elements with
        CSS to create a polished look. One of the most impactful lessons for me was learning about web accessibility.
        How color contrast, alt text, and thoughtful design choices ensure that websites are usable for everyone.
        This course gave me a solid foundation not only in technical skills but also in thinking like a designer who
        puts user experience first.</p>
