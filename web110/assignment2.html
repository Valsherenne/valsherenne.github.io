    Activity 4: Configure Browser Settings
    For this activity, I needed to set my settings to my preferred browser, Chrome, to my best user experience. When it
    comes to Chrome, I've noticed that the browser takes up alot of memory, So I dug around to see how I can help my own
    performance when browsing. I did this by enabling memory saver in the settings. What I learned when doing this
    activity is that if you go digging into the settings of your perferred browser, you can get the experience you want
    with some tinkering. This information is useful in the future as I can do this with any webbrowser with just a
    couple of google searches.</p>

    Activity 5: Configure browser extensions and add-ons
    The activity teaches me what addons and extensions are and their purpose: enhancing browser functionality by
    providing additional features. With some research, I discovered useful tools including: ad blockers, grammar
    checkers, and shopping extensions such as Honey, which streamline my online experience. Chrome makes it easy to
    install and uninstall these extensions, offering a straightforward process for anyone, no matter their experience on
    the web. The vast catalog of extensions ensures that finding the right extension to meet my needs is simple and
    efficient. For the near future, Chrome's extensions provide valuable support for whatever I need, making my online
    activities smoother and more enjoyable overall.
