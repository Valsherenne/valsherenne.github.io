    Activity 4: Configure Browser Settings
    For this activity, I needed to set my settings to my preferred browser, Chrome, to my best user experience. When it
    comes to Chrome, I've noticed that the browser takes up alot of memory, So I dug around to see how I can help my own
    performance when browsing. I did this by enabling memory saver in the settings. What I learned when doing this
    activity is that if you go digging into the settings of your perferred browser, you can get the experience you want
    with some tinkering. This information is useful in the future as I can do this with any webbrowser with just a
    couple of google searches.</p>

  <p>Activity 5: Configure browser extensions and add-ons
    The activity explains what addons and extensions are, which add features or functions to enhance your functionality
    of the browser. With some research, it was easy to find extensions that would make my experiences easier, including
    many adblocks, extensions to fix my grammar, and even shopping extensions such as Honey. For chrome, it's easy to
    install and uninstall extensions, and with a massive catalogue of extensions, it's easy to find one that's suitable
    for me.
