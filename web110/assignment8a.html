    <p> Understanding how making lists in HTML is important due to not just formatting, but also to organize files in an
        easy and concise way. I already had previous knowledge of the ul tag before, but understanding where the folders
        are located has always been something that was tricky for me, so practice assignments such as these really
        help. I also learned that lists help with accessibility, which I never really thought about before until 
        I delved deeper into them. </p>
