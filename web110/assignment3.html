        Activity 6: Use the internet Archive
        This activity focuses on the Wayback machine, which is a very famous website which allows users to easily access
        archived versions of websites from the past. This usually contains snapshots of specific pages during a time
        period (for example, if you wanted to see how a website looked like in 2009, you would be able to do so if
        people have collected data from that time period into the wayback machine. This also means that websites that
        don't exist anymore/paragraphs that have been deleted can be found again. This activity explains how I can
        easily add a page into the wayback machine, so just in case it gets deleted or lost, I can find it again. With
        this knowledge, I would be able to save any website that I want easily, which is so important for keeping the
        history of the internet, as it can easily be lost through the passage of time. </p>

        Activity 2: Compare Search Engines
        For this activity, I compared several popular search engines to see what engine gives the best results, as well
        as have the best user interface. Afterwards, I looked at the search engine market share, where google reigns by
        a landslide compared to the other engines. From What I can see, many other engines, excluding bing, has a harder
        time with anything that is not english. However, unlike google, bing has a very busy interface which makes it
        hard for users to use. Unfortunately, google reigns because it's very easy to actually use and has a clean
        interface. With all this together, I don't believe google will ever not be the most popular search engine.
        activities smoother and more enjoyable overall.
